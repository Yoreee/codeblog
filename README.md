## CODEBLOG README

I made this application because I wanted a way to keep track of issues I have with my projects, my thought process, and solution to those issues. I also wanted to use it as an opportunity to try out Backbone with Rails as an API. It was fun to make. I plan on expanding on this and on making bigger projects with these technologies.

### Things I plan on adding/improving:
* Edit form should display all text rather than just the little input box
* Add some color
* Articles should show date/time created
* Add admin panel so everyone can't edit/delete my posts
* Add a search feature and tags to display similar articles
* Allow user comments
